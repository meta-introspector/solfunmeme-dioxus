Ideas:
1. gcc asts, metacoq, lean4 dumper and rust procedureal macros and rust syn parsers produce expressions
2. we can import those as "memes"
3. the interpretation of the expressions as a group of memes is supported (import etc)
4. writing proofs and validating interpretations.
5. creating llm content from the memes, expanding them.
